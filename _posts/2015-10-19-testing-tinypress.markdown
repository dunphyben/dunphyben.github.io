# Oh hai!

This is my first paragraph. Will hitting enter create a new line?
Or will I have to use two spaces like markdown requires, such as at the end of this sentence?  
  
Ok so there should be a space between this line and the line before me.

## So this is an H2!
### And this is an H3!

Wicked. Ok, let's try lists

1. This is one
2. and two
3. and three

But don't forget letters!

a. this is
b. a list
c. of letters

And last but not least, _bold_ content or ~~strikethrough~~ content or **what's this?**

    code


```
github code?
```

regular `inline code` 

end.
